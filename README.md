# NLP Project

### Project Overview
This repository contains three interconnected projects aimed at enhancing recruitment processes through technology:

### 1. Resume Parsing and Analysis
This module focuses on extracting key information from resumes, such as:

Name
Education
Work Experience
Skills
The extracted data is then used to match candidates to job descriptions, streamlining the recruitment process. The matching algorithm compares candidate profiles with job requirements, providing a list of best-fit candidates.

### 2. Candidate Matching
Using machine learning techniques, this recommendation system matches candidates to job openings. The model is trained on historical hiring data, allowing it to predict candidate-job compatibility effectively. 

### 3. Chatbot Development
A conversational AI designed to:

Answer Common Queries: Provides information about job applications, interview processes, and company culture.
Guide Candidates: Assists candidates through the job application process using Natural Language Processing (NLP) for smooth interactions.
This chatbot improves candidate experience by providing instant responses and personalized assistance.
